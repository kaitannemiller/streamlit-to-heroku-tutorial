- She's giving me
more confidence.

00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,754
- Yeah.
- You're both here

00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,356
as Bachelorettes.

00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,724
How crazy is that?

00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,027
- I think the best-case
scenario was, you know,

00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:49,829
being the Bachelorette
after everything.

00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,331
But knowing Rachel
is by my side

00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,866
and having a friend
was icing on the cake

00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,336
and something I didn't
even know to ask for.

00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,304
So I'm so excited

00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,206
and so grateful.
- Me too.

00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,574
- You're both gonna hold hands
the entire time too?

00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,743
[laughter]
- We're not gonna let go.

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,346
- I was gonna say,
you're holding on tight.

00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,914
- Yeah.

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,115
- So obviously, you know,
we've never done

00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,516
anything like this before.

00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,685
Two Bachelorettes
for an entire season.

00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,721
How is this whole thing
gonna work?

00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,622
- We're just gonna be learning
along the way.

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,057
Of course, we're gonna make
some mistakes,

00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,259
but I have her to help me,
so...

00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,561
- Yeah.
- Think we'll be okay.

00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,863
- You're about to date
the most men...

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,131
- The most?
- We've ever had

00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,467
in a single season.
- This is crazy.

00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,735
- Wow, I like
the sound of that.

00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,470
- Does that sound okay?
- It sounds okay.

00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,738
I still don't believe it.
- Think you can handle it?

00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,873
- I can handle it, maybe.
- I think we're ready.

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,042
- Yeah.
- We're ready to go.

00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,478

And I only live
about an hour from you.

to move too far.

time in the hospital as well.

is important.

00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,398

based on everything

that's happened to you,
I'm a person

that is very intentional.

And just, you know, a little
background story of me,

00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,987
how intentional I am, is,

00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:39,491
You know, I haven't had sex
in a year and almost a half,

00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,961
so I've been saving it
for the right person.

00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,362

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,830

to give you guys a hug.

"I haven't had sex
in a year and a half,"

00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,143

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,351
and when they're gonna,
you know,

00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,220
cut us off here.

00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,755
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh.

00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,056
Mic drop?

00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,324
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,959
- That's right, I did that.
- To the floor?

00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,194
[laughs]

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,297
- It's gonna be a long night.

00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,033
- So I know that
a long night in heels...

00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,334
- Oh, thank you.
- Can be...

00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,969
- This might be the best
introduction we've seen.

00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,370
- Yeah, of course.
- A front-row seat.

00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:53,705
- Yeah, I have a mother
and a sister,

00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,807
so I know
how long nights can be.

00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:56,975
both: Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,643
I'll see you both inside.
- Oh!

00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,644
Can we keep these chairs?
- Yeah.

00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:01,379
[laughter]
- That was it?

00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,614
- That's it.

00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,849
I just wanted
to give you guys a breather

00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,116
from being on your feet.
- Oh, that's so nice!

00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,718
- Oh, thank you.
We appreciate it.

00:33:06,785 --> 00:33:08,887
- We'll be taking these chairs
with us everywhere.

00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,288
[laughter]
Bye, Spencer.

00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,390
- See you guys.
- See you soon.

00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,825
- I liked him.
- What a gentleman.

00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:15,260
- He's my type.

00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,129
- Oh, he's cute.
- [laughing] Yeah.

00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,731
<i>I think Spencer is really cute</i>

00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,366
<i>and he has great style.</i>

00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,701
- Cute, cute, cute.

00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,735
Good...
- I know.

00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,203
- Good limo.
- Yeah.

00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,771
<i>I hope Rachel's not into him</i>

00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,374
<i>because I want</i>
<i>to get to know him.</i>

00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,809
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>there's so many men,</i>

00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,144
<i>there's two of us,</i>
<i>and it's clear that</i>

00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,747
we're going to be attracted
to the same guys.

00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:37,182
- I honestly feel like
the luckiest guy

00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,783
in the world right now,
standing in front of you two.

00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,653
And I can confidently say two
is definitely better than one.

00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,222
- [laughs] Yeah.
- Of course.

00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,558
<i>- I mean, it's gonna get</i>
<i>pretty tricky,</i>

00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:49,060
and I think
there's going to be hardship

00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,062
with dating
the same pool of men.

00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,298
- You know, this is history in
the making, two Bachelorettes.

00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,800
Like, how is this gonna work?
You know what I'm saying?

00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,104
- If two of them ultimately
end up being into, like, one,

00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,306
that's gonna be, like,
a real interesting scenario.

00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,975
- This morning, I woke up,

00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,678
I opened my eyes, and...

00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:08,580
both: Oh!

00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,048
- I see you, Rachel,

00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,884
and you, Gabby.

00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,786
- Nice!
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:17,289
But now that I have met
you guys,

00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,524
I will say the real thing
is much better.

00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,892
<i>- This is crazy.</i>

00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,328
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>how this is gonna work.</i>

00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,930
<i>It worries me a little bit</i>

00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,599
because I definitely feel like
Gabby and I

00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,000
could fall for the same guys.

00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,869
- I am a professional
race car driver.

00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:32,070
- Oh, wow.

00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,471
- So you could say
that I'm used to

00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,206
some wild and crazy rides.

00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,475
<i>- I mean, we only have so many</i>
<i>guys here we can date.</i>

00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,011
We're gonna, obviously,
both like a couple of them.

00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,880
- Do either of you guys know
how to tie a tie?

00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,548
Please help me.
- Oh, I can maybe--

00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:45,083
- Give it your best shot.
- Should I try?

00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,118
<i>- I really hope</i>
<i>that doesn't happen,</i>

00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,287
but of course
I want to remain open.

00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:50,822
- Oh, perfect.
- Yeah.

00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,991
- Just fold it down,
fold it back up.

00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,993
Rachel, please help.
- [laughs]

00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,462
- Well, I look pretty good.

00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:59,931
<i>- At the end of the day,</i>
<i>it is an individual journey.</i>

00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:03,868
We both are here to find
our own individual husbands,

00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,203
hopefully.

00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,639
- All right.
Rachel, Gabby.

00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09,741
You've now met all 32 men.

00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,143
I mean, that's a lot of guys
to meet in one night.

00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,112
- It's a lot,
but we have each other.

00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,614
- Right, we're willing

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,315
to take on the challenge!
- Divide and conquer!

00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:18,717
- Yeah.

00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,918
- It is a lot of guys, though.

00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,419
For real, a lot of people here.

00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,521
- The more competition,
the better, right?

00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,757
<i>- The guys are all here</i>
<i>and it is crowded</i>

00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,892
and hot in here,
that's for sure.

00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,060
- You guys have a strategy

00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,362
how you're gonna divide
and conquer?

00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,429
- Yeah.
- Hopefully we can just

00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,697
figure it out on the way.

00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,032
See where the night takes us.

00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,900
<i>- This is going to be wild.</i>

00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,235
<i>There's two girls.</i>

00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,637
<i>There's two.</i>

00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,039
I can't even anticipate
what's gonna happen.

00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,540
- I don't know
how these two Bachelorettes--

00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,842
how this is gonna go.

00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,510
There's a lot of questions
that's gonna happen

00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,145
down the line for all of us.
- Yeah.

00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,647
<i>- There's no precedent</i>
<i>for this.</i>

00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,882
There's no basis for this
at all.

00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,318
- Having the two Bachelorettes
is legendary.

00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:55,787
It's also gonna create
some drama, for sure.

00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,856
<i>- Naturally, as men,</i>
<i>we're territorial,</i>

00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,624
but we got two Bachelorettes.

00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:01,226
It's a different ball game.

00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,961
- It's definitely gonna be
double the fun,

00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,229
you know, double the action,

00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,998
double the chances
to find love, I feel like.

00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,567
<i>- So you gotta make it known</i>
<i>that you're a contender.</i>

00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,603
And guess what?
You're talking to Mario.

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,272
Hey, we ready for whatever.

00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,041
We ready for whatever.

00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,642
- To history
in the making here.

00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,644
We got Gabby and Rachel.

00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,980
"Bachelorette" season 19.
Let's do it, gentlemen.

00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,381
- Whoo!

00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,784
all: Cheers.
- Let's go!

00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,922
- My heart has been
pounding nonstop

00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,357
ever since I've seen them both.

00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,758
And...
- Same.

00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,494
I'm just excited to talk,
get some words out there.

00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,129
- Like, rolling up
in that limo,

00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,798
and there's two out there,
it's like...

00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,865
- Both beautiful.
- Both gorgeous.

00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,100
- I didn't even know
what to do.

00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:43,968
- They're gonna marry
one of us, you know,

00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,071
whether it's, you know,
it's out here--

00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,972
obviously me--or in there.

00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,008
[laughter]

00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,309
- We're excited.
- Yeah.

00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,645
- Well, I know all these men
are so anxious

00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,447
to meet you all and get
a chance to sit down with you

00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:56,581
and get to know you better.

00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,083
I know you're also
very excited too.

00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,751
But before we get to that,

00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,020
I do want to talk you through
what's gonna happen tonight.

00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,022
So obviously, you're both gonna
go into the party.

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,824
You're gonna have a chance,
both of you,

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,592
to speak to every single one
of the guys,

00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,327
just like any other
Bachelorette would do.

00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,695
Now, later in the night,
obviously,

00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,263
there'll be
a First Impression Rose.

00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,698
- That's awesome.
- And you're gonna

00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,734
hand that out
to that special someone

00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,302
that you feel a really strong
connection with.

00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,403
- Oh, my goodness.

00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,238
This is crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,774
- Get ready for the night
of your lives.

00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:23,942
Head on in.

00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,276
Gabby, Rachel, good luck.
- Let's do it!

00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:26,644
- Bye, Jesse!

00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,180
[laughing]
- Oh, my God.

00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,250
<i>- Having two Bachelorettes</i>
<i>is crazy.</i>

00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:36,621
<i>I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>how this is gonna work.</i>

00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:38,223
How does the First Impression
Rose work?

00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,858
What if we want to give it
to the same person?

00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,127
<i>There's so many questions</i>
<i>moving forward.</i>

00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,362
- Who are you guys gonna talk
to first, Gabby or Rachel?

00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,698
- I just want a chance
to showcase who I am

00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,067
to one or both of them,
honestly, on the first night.

00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,769
- You can't go wrong
with either one of them.

00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,304
[indistinct chatter]

00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,207
[all cheering]

00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,411
- Finally!
- Whoo!

00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,213
- Wow, you guys look
incredible.

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,748
Thank you so much.
- Of course.

00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,483
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,418
- That's that
Southern hospitality there.

00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,053
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh, well,

00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,457
we are both
so excited to be here.

00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,993
- Yeah, we know what it's like
being in your guys' shoes.

00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,861
We were just there
not that long ago.

00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,329
- I think I was standing
right back there.

00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,898
[laughter]

00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,066
- And we just want to say
thank you so much.

00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,169
We know, like, how much
of a sacrifice

00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,670
it is to be here.

00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,539
There's so much unknown,

00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,674
but the more you lean in,
truly,

00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,276
the more you do get out.

00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,145
So I hope you guys can
trust us along the way.

00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,581
- Gabby and I,
we're both really confident

00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,051
that if you guys are open
and vulnerable

00:38:40,118 --> 00:38:43,021
and give us all
good communication,

00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,523
that love is here.

00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,559
- Yeah, as--I don't know
if you guys know,

00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,195
but this is the most men
we've ever had here.

00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:51,429
- We noticed.

00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,831
[laughter]
We noticed for sure.

00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,099
- The testosterone is flowing.

00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,401
- It feels good.

00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,203
- Yeah!
[laughter]

00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,838
- But we are breaking
new ground

00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,740
with two Bachelorettes
and with all of you guys,

00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,876
so I hope we're patient
with each other.

00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,145
- Yeah, we just look forward
to this journey.

00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,814
It's gonna be a wild ride.

00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,783
I'm ready.
- Let's do it!

00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,152
[all cheering]
- Should we cheers? Yes!

00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,154
Cheers!
- Cheers!

00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,422
- Cheers.

00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:18,590
- We'll get better at that.

00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:19,757
We'll get better at the cheers.

00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,193
[laughter]
- Yeah, it's a lot at once.

00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,196
I honestly have no clue

00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,232
how the night's gonna work
having two of us.

00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,601
<i>I kind of just have</i>
<i>no expectations right now.</i>

00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,835
<i>I just want to have</i>
<i>a good time,</i>

00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,303
<i>almost, like, get my feet wet</i>

00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,974
in the sense that I'm dating,
like, multiple guys.

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,842
- Do y'all want to see
a couple of magic tricks?

00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,044
- Would love.
- All right.

00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,446
Do you guys remember my name?

00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:42,480
- Roby.

00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,514
- How do you remember it?

00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,515
- 'Cause--
- Magic.

00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,583
[laughter]

00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,318
- Here. Grab one.
- Oh, do it. Okay.

00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,486
- I'll keep going.
- Got it.

00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,854
- Look at it, both of you.

00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,122
- Ooh.

00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,491
- Good, good, good.
Say "stop" at any moment.

00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,559
- Stop.

00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,994
- Put your card down
right over here.

00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,495
<i>[whimsical music]</i>

00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,465
So I just rub down the pants,
and I get a bit of color

00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,734
from the pants...

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,435
into the pack, like so.

00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,970
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yes.

00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:07,305
Now, that color could
have gone anywhere.

00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,806
It went to that seven
of hearts, yes?

00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,942
both: Oh!

00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,977
- The magician.
He pulled a Houdini.

00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,479
- I feel like, honestly, like,

00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,481
yeah, you can give them, like,
tricks and stuff like that,

00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,683
but at the end of the day,
how long is that gonna work?

00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,018
- I don't want it to be
the Roby Show.

00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,753
I want it to be the Rachel--

00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,887
this is the Rachel
and Gabby Show.

00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,355
[laughter]

00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,757
How is it like being
on the other side

00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,292
of the table right now?

00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,760
- It's refreshing.
- Yeah?

00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,061
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,829
- It's like you're in
the position of power.

00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:33,531
You have the authority.
You have the control.

00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,600
You know, you can say
that "no."

00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:36,968
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,336
How are you feeling?

00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:39,904
- I'm so nervous.
It's frenetic.

00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,105
- That's normal.
- Yeah.

00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,173
- We've been there.
- Yeah?

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,608
- Yeah.
- Definitely normal.

00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,743
- What was the scariest
moment for you?

00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,612
- Um, all of it.

00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,714
- All of it?
- [laughs] I mean...

00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,249
- Where are they?
I want to find them.

00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,217
That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, we have to.

00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,186
- She's still over there?
- No.

00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,587
- Are you gonna sneak in there
and steal some time?

00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,789
- You've got to be sneaky.

00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,257
Just a little bit.
- But do you want to step

00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:01,426
on people's toes?
I don't know, 'cause...

00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:02,694
- Not on your toes, for sure.

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,196
You're at the most--
you're most vulnerable!

00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,598
- Might have to be aggressive
to really get that time

00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:11,869
and actually make a--
I guess, like, an impression.

00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,671
- Double the trouble.

00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,173
- [laughing]
We love it.

00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,607
- We wanted to meet
you guys together

00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,976
'cause, obviously, we're twins,

00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,978
but we want you to see
the differences between us,

00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,412
'cause our personalities,
I feel like,

00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,880
we're very different.

00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,048
For me, for instance,
I feel like

00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,383
I'm a little bit more
of a laid-back,

00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,285
reserved kind of person,
a little bit outgoing.

00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,786
He's more of a bold,

00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,355
out-there type person.
- Bold...

00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,489
Okay.
- Yeah.

00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,157
- So that's how we kind
of differentiate

00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,726
between each other
and who we attract,

00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,494
who we don't attract, like,
so that's how we...

00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:37,729
yeah.
- Okay.

00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,930
- Yeah, so, definitely.

00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,165
- How does it feel
coming in together?

00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,134
- You guys definitely
make us feel calm, though.

00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,069
I could tell that energy,
that--yeah, exactly.

00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,405
- You bring
such positive energy.

00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:48,706
- So you guys--
- That's so nice.

00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,542
- Yeah, yeah.
You're--so, okay.

00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,344
You guys said you have
your differences.

00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,812
- Yes.
- So what is

00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,614
the differences
besides personality-wise?

00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,049
Hobbies?

00:41:58,116 --> 00:41:59,917
- No--honestly, not a lot.
- Or same hobbies?

00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,519
- Everything.
- So we're all the same?

00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,688
- Yeah.
- Went to the same school.

00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:05,823
- Oh, so you guys
never separate?

00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,326
- Well, we didn't live together
all throughout school.

00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:09,727
We did, like, a couple
of years and then we, like,

00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:10,795
separated
'cause we wanted to do

00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:11,929
our own thing
and be individual.

00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,898
- Absolutely.
- We had to, you know.

00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,266
- Yeah. Kind of--
- Like job-wise,

00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,567
we do the same job.
- Yeah, what's job?

00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,870
So we're--medical
advertising's what we do,

00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,972
but both
separate companies, though.

00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,107
So, like,
that's the only difference.

00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,675
<i>- The conversations</i>
<i>with the twins</i>

00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,977
and Rachel and I

00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,578
is--just ain't working for me,

00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,547
kind of, romantically.

00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:32,850
I feel like I can't,
like, build a very strong bond

00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:34,685
<i>with either of the twins.</i>

00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,523
Yeah, it's just, like...

00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,391
I don't know.

00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,927
It ain't doing it for me.
[laughs]

00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,229
Do you feel like you guys
can read each other's minds?

00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,731
- Like, across campus
in college,

00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:48,499
I could spot him
from miles away.

00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,334
- Oh, wow.
- Stuff like that.

00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,369
Do you guys experience
any of that,

00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,603
you know, being together?

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,205
- We weren't
in the womb together, so--

00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,607
[laughter]
I think it's much different.

00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:57,708
- We can read
each other's minds.

00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,277
- Yeah.
- Never know.

00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,013
- There's me, there's Gabby,
there's both the twins.

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,748
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>trying to get us to go</i>

00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,917
<i>on double dates,</i>
<i>planning for the future,</i>

00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,553
<i>but definitely hard</i>
<i>to form a connection</i>

00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,755
<i>when there's multiple people</i>
<i>sitting here.</i>

00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,523
I'm not into it.

00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,991
- The one thing I want
to get across is,

00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,126
I'm here for something real.

00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:16,327
- Okay, me too. Awesome.

00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,563
- And I want to be here.
I want to be super open.

00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,499
And whenever I found out both
of you were the Bachelorettes--

00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:22,600
- Yeah, what were
your thoughts on that?

00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:23,601
Were you nervous?
- It was a little scary.

00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:24,602
Exactly.
I was a little nervous.

00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:25,803
Like, I came into this,

00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,271
I kind of showed you guys...

00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,439
I wanted to, like,
separate you two.

00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:30,808
That's how I did
the earphone thing.

00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,844
- And we definitely
noticed that as well.

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,078
- So I wanted to,
like, show you that,

00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,780
like, I had
the Florida vibe with you.

00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,682
And then I didn't want you
to hear what I said to her.

00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,617
- I heard.
[both laugh]

00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:42,587
But no, I appreciate that,
because it really does mean

00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,890
a lot for, you know, someone
to come in and give us both,

00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,126
individually, like,
our own attention.

00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,527
- You two
are very different.

00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,562
But I understand, you're, like,
on the same journey,

00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,631
but you have
your own separate journeys.

00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:54,866
So, like,
I wanted to come in and be

00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,034
able to show you
that, like, I recognize you,

00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,636
I recognize her
in different ways.

00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,505
- Yeah.
- And, like, that's

00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,739
kind of how I came up
with what I did.

00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,541
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

00:44:03,608 --> 00:44:05,042
<i>- Tonight, at the beginning,</i>
<i>it was a little awkward</i>

00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,545
<i>just because</i>
<i>me and Gabby really</i>

00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:09,780
<i>don't want it</i>
<i>to be a competition.</i>

00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,350
Of course, Gabby and I are
in this journey together,

00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,987
but little moments like that
where the men are able

00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,657
to make me feel like
I'm the only girl there,

00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:22,260
it's important, I think,
for Gabby and I

00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,528
both to feel different.

00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,329
- All right,
so if I'm gonna ever

00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,564
bring you home, to Boston,

00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:28,065
to meet my friends and family,

00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,567
you're gonna stick out
like a sore thumb.

00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:31,169
- Oh, why? Okay.
- Unless...

00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,703
unless we teach you the lingo.

00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,372
- Oh, God.
- I know you know English,

00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:35,706
but this is different.

00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,508
- Barely.
- All right.

00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:38,709
So I'm gonna be a teacher.
- Oh!

00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,778
How did I miss that whiteboard?

00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,879
- If you're walking
down the street

00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:43,080
and you want to say "hi"
to someone...

00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,649
- Uh-huh.

00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,317
You write like a five-year-old.

00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,187
No, that's pretty good.
"Hello, good"?

00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,454
- Will you chill?

00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,689
Can you let me finish?

00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:52,857
- [laughing]

00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:56,093
- "Hello, good sir. How..."

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,962
- You don't say "good sir."

00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,264
- So we're being very proper.
- Is Boston in like, the 1800s?

00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,399
- If you wanted to say this,
super proper--

00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,533
- People say that
with a straight face?

00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,435
- Gabby, Gabby, zhh, zhh.
- No, they don't.

00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,304
Okay, okay.
- Gabber, Gabber.

00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,905
Look at me. Look at me. Shh.

00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,073
- Okay, I'm done.

00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,341
- We're gonna say it
in Boston...

00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:12,710
- Uh-huh.
- This is what we do.

00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,378
<i>- Ryan is really fun.</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,315
<i>we have great energy</i>
<i>right off the bat.</i>

00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,616
[with Boston accent]
Hey, guy, how are you?

00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:20,585
I could do that.
- Beautiful.

00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,386
<i>- He's super easy to talk to.</i>

00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,422
We can just kind of, like, give
each other a little [bleep]

00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,958
and just, like, overall,
enjoy his company.

00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,292
Do I have a booger?

00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,827
- No. Do you? No.

00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,095
- [laughs]
- You have something...

00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:32,597
- No, do I have one?

00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,764
- Oh, my--
- No, stop!

00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,299
- Gab, Gab, you gotta go.
- Do I?

00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,601
- Cut, cut--
no, I'm just kidding.

00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,436
You don't have anything.
You have nothing. Nothing.

00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,638
- Knowing that Ryan
is already so invested

00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:41,973
is such a good feeling.

00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,174
- I was so pumped to meet you

00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,508
because you're
absolutely hysterical.

00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,244
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:49,547
<i>- I can't wait to see what</i>
<i>the rest of the night brings.</i>

00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,187
<i>- I can't pick</i>
<i>who I like more.</i>

00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,555
You know, I'm really excited

00:45:57,622 --> 00:45:59,090
to just get one-on-one time
with both,

00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,025
get a fair shot with both,
and just see

00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,193
who I have
a better connection with.

00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,628
I think that's important.

00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,496
- They both have different
qualities that are amazing,

00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,832
so it is possible
that you could

00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,433
fall for both
and not even know it

00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,135
until you, like, wake up
one day, and like,

00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:12,970
"Man, what do I choose?"
- Especially there's two.

00:46:13,037 --> 00:46:15,072
- What do I choose?
- Yeah.

00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,240
- Oof!

00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:17,441
- We'll warm you up out here.

00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,410
- Yeah, we need a blanket
or something.

00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,712
The night started off
a little bit awkward,

00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,615
but since we've
been able to separate,

00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:27,385
<i>getting to talk to these guys</i>
<i>individually is almost</i>

00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,854
<i>like meeting them again</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,921
- I went to UCF.

00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,089
- No way.

00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,291
- And so I live in Tampa now,
though.

00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,859
- My brother lives in Tampa.

00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,094
I am really hopeful
that I'm gonna start

00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,130
making more
romantic connections

00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,799
with these guys,
because that's why I'm here

00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,234
and that's what
I'm looking for.

00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,102
- I know that
a couple of weeks ago,

00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,137
it was your birthday.

00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,272
- It was!
- Okay.

00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:49,940
So I had plenty
of time to do this.

00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,509
- Oh, my goodness.

00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,146
Oh, my--
[laughs]

00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,048
- I had plenty of time.
- Can I read it?

00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,949
- Yes, I would love for you
to read it.

00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,785
- "Happy birthday, Rachel.

00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,621
"I know your birthday
was a few weeks ago,

00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:06,324
"but it's never too late
for best wishes.

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,626
"I hope your life is filled
with an abundance

00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,797
"of love, joy,
and most of all, me.

00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:15,533
Love, your co-pilot, Hayden."

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,935
Oh, my gosh, I love it.

00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,804
This is so special.

00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,673
Oh, my goodness.
- Well, that came from heart.

00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,176
<i>- Hayden is so cute.</i>

00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,446
He really went out of his way
to let me know

00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,815
that he's interested
in being here for me,

00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,085
<i>and that makes me</i>
<i>feel so special.</i>

00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,021
<i>I definitely feel</i>
<i>a spark with Hayden.</i>

00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:38,622
- I've had this
for a long time, basically.

00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,191
It's just a list
of, like, attributes

00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,759
that--about a future wife.
- Aww.

00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,160
- I'm not sure
if you have one of these.

00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:45,596
It's kind of cringy,
but then I'm like, all right.

00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,965
- No, that's okay.
No, I appreciate the effort.

00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:49,700
I feel like it's important
to think about these things,

00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:51,969
for sure, especially going into
something like this where...

00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,137
- Oh, my gosh.
- You know, you don't really

00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,271
know what you're going into.

00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,773
- Well, I don't know,
at the same time,

00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,475
like, are we gonna be good
together?

00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,776
- Totally.
- Is there things

00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:01,846
that are going to, you know,
branch out for us?

00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,414
Like,
this is not just a first date.

00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,850
It's, like, almost like
a first everything.

00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,185
So I'll kind of go over these.
- Right, right.

00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:11,021
- So the first attribute
of a future partner is,

00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,424
is open and honest
with her feelings.

00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:16,560
They are intentional
in everything that they do.

00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,662
Takes care
of herself physically.

00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,498
So hopefully you take care--

00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,166
[both laugh]
I mean...

00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,469
<i>- Shirtless Jacob,</i>
<i>his pecs are rock-hard.</i>

00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:27,671
- Lives a very passionate life.

00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,440
- I can't stop looking at 'em.

00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,610
- Yeah, and then has
a good sense of humor.

00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,112
So obviously, I think
we're good on that part, maybe.

00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:36,414
- Yeah.

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,415
He's great.

00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,918
He came to our conversation

00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,753
very intentional,

00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,756
<i>which is nice, but he was</i>
<i>way more shy than I thought.</i>

00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,191
I thought they were
gonna be kissing

00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,326
all over the place,
but they haven't.

00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:52,530
- I guess, isn't afraid
of physical touch.

00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,531
- Yeah.
- So, I mean...

00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,267
[laughter]

00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,568
- I'm terrified. No.

00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,470
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,505
<i>I think</i>
<i>physical chemistry means</i>

00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,073
<i>so much,</i>
<i>especially when you're dating,</i>

00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,276
<i>in order to, like,</i>
<i>keep the attraction.</i>

00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,978
<i>So I feel like kissing</i>
<i>is really important.</i>

00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,047
- Like, you think
anyone's kissed them yet?

00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,416
I'd kiss both of them, but I
don't know how that would work.

00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,718
- Yeah.
- Before I kiss one of them,

00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,554
I gotta figure out
which one I like.

00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,355
'cause I'm not gonna play.
I'm not gonna play with them.

00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,624
- It's a delicate process
where you can't

00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,293
come on too strong,
but you have to be a little bit

00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,029
selfish and just be you
to figure out, like,

00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:26,864
is there
that instant chemistry?

00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,299
- You know, one thing
I definitely wanted

00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,868
to let you know up front is,
you know what you said

00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:34,038
inside about kinda opening up
and vulnerability?

00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,239
- It's very important to me.

00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,640
- It's very important,
yeah, I know.

00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,476
But it's like,
it's always been kind of tough

00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,045
for me to do that early on.
- Okay.

00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,447
- But I want you to know that,
you know, I'm here for you.

00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,882
- Yeah.
- And I'm willing

00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,283
to kind of meet you there.

00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,785
And it might
take me a little bit

00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:48,853
longer than some
of the other people...

00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,354
- We'll work on it.
- We'll try.

00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,456
But, you know,
I'm gonna give it my absolute,

00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,525
100% best
when it comes to that.

00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:58,028
<i>- I really liked Aven</i>
<i>right off the bat.</i>

00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,997
Kind of wearing your heart
on your sleeve,

00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,132
even when it's scary.
- I know.

00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:06,270
<i>- He definitely was inching</i>
<i>a little bit closer to me...</i>

00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,572
- I'm just--I'm like,
oh, my gosh,

00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:10,474
I really, really hope
this experience is

00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,843
so much better
for the both of you.

00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,178
- Yeah.

00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,179
- That must have been a lot.

00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,481
<i>[romantic music]</i>

00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:19,083
<i>- But there was no kiss.</i>

00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,818
- It was so great
to talk to you.

00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,720
- Maybe it just wasn't
the right moment.

00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,221
Maybe he was nervous.

00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:26,991
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what's going on with him,</i>

00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,359
but I, at least for me,

00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,827
thought it was
a good conversation.

00:50:29,894 --> 00:50:31,695
- So I understand
that you're a pilot.

00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,231
- I am.
- Right, and that's super cool.

00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:36,133
So me being a race car driver,

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,236
I might have brought
my actual race car.

00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,738
- Oh, my goodness!
- To show you.

00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,006
- Whoa!

00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,274
- This is what's called
a Top Fuel dragster.

00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,642
- Oh, my goodness.

00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,410
- So this is the car
that I drive.

00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,512
- So you sit...
- Right in here.

00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,880
- Oh, my God.

00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,417
- So that's where I sit.
- Whoa!

00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:54,785
- Here's my controls
in here, so...

00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:55,853
- Okay.

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,087
- So these two levers
right here

00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:59,123
are the parachutes, so I go--

00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,824
- Wait, so you go,
like, really fast

00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,726
and then the parachutes
go out the back?

00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,095
- I've gone 330 miles an hour.
- Are you serious?

00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:06,797
- This thing goes
330 miles an hour.

00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:07,865
- Oh, my goodness.

00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:09,466
- It's pretty big, though,
isn't it?

00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:12,136
With you being a pilot and all,
you know, you spent hours

00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,638
and hours learning
how to fly a plane, you know,

00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,006
learning the controls,
all that sort of thing.

00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,142
So, you know,
I kind of did the same thing.

00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,344
And so when you drive
one of these things,

00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,246
you have to learn
what the controls are,

00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:23,447
all those kind of things.

00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,015
So hopefully one day,
you can show me

00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,217
how to fly a plane,
and one day I can

00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,252
show you how to drive
this thing.

00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,820

00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,590
<i>- Jordan V.</i>

00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:36,560
I enjoyed our conversation,
and I feel like,

00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,396
in a way,
we do have a lot in common.

00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:41,765

00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,867

00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,436

00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:46,670
- I came here for you, so...

00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,672
- Oh, for me? Really?

00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:49,773
- Yes.

00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,077
I don't know if you're
familiar with horsepower,

00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,112
but it makes
11,000 horsepower, so...

00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:58,215
- Oh, my goodness. Wow.

00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,252

00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:11,929
Clayton kissed me on night one.

00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,163
- I noticed
when you guys were in there,

00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,798
one of the things you said,
you were like,

00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,534
just to kind of be
more open and honest

00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:19,737
right now,
like, to be vulnerable.

00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,205
And that's, like,
a part of the journey.

00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:23,641
And then you guys were like,
"Cheers up to that!" right?

00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:25,676
And I was like "Oh, okay."
- Yeah. Do it now!

00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:27,778
- But, like, what does that,
like, look like for you?

00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:29,813
Considering, you know,
Clayton was like, "I love you."

00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,415
- Right, right.
- And then you fell through.

00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,917
How has your lens
changed in that area?

00:52:34,018 --> 00:52:36,887
- For me, it took me--
I definitely got there,

00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:38,489
but it took me
a little bit of time

00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,325
to be more vulnerable

00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:43,394
and kind of share my story

00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,396
and have faith in myself

00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,398
and the relationship
that I was building.

00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,866
- Yeah.
- I think it's so important

00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:50,200
to just, like, trust your gut

00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,269
and know
what you have to offer.

00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,404
- Absolutely.
I just want you to know

00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:54,805
I'm coming to you
with a open heart.

00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,573
I think, naturally,
as, like, a man,

00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,142
you know, I think
in our culture today, like,

00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,911
there's this stigma that,
like, men are just closed off,

00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,780
like, you know,
they have walls up,

00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,381
but I'm willing
to be vulnerable...

00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:05,616
- Yeah.
- And to just be

00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,084
present-minded with you,
you know what I'm saying?

00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,285
- Totally.
And that's a good sentiment.

00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,420
- Just not, like,
going through the motions.

00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,654
You know
what I'm saying, right?

00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:11,989
It's like, "All right,
hey, you take care."

00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,057
You know what I'm saying?

00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,625
- You just hit my reflex
in my knee.

00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,427

just kick off?

00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:48,432
- It's, like, different
being with them

00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,267
separately than it was
when they were, like,

00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:52,002
introducing themselves
to us both.

00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,303
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,972
- Now I kind of understand
how you can

00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,807
have feelings
for multiple people.

00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,476
- Are you saying you're falling
in love with three women?

00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:00,877
- I'm in love with everybody!

00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,046
- "I'm in love,
and it feels so good."

00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,281
- Yeah.

00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,016
<i>I think tonight</i>
<i>is going really well.</i>

00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,019
<i>These guys have already made</i>
<i>such good impressions,</i>

00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,254
so I'm really excited
to see how the rest

00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,957
of tonight goes
and see what happens.

00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:17,127
[indistinct chatter]

00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:18,762
- My man, my man!

00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,497
- Gentlemen.
How are we doing?

00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:21,865
How are we doing?

00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:23,934
A little something
for Gabby and Rachel.

00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,936
I'll put it right there.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:26,970
See you guys.
- All right.

00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,438
My man Jesse.

00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,507
- Oh, there's two. Yay.
- There's two.

00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,642
- Two is better than one,
you know?

00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,444
- Makes it a little more real.

00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,846
- Makes it a lot more real.

00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,715
That thing's staring me
right in the face, you know?

00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,484
<i>- I think hearts kind of drop</i>
<i>a little bit, you know,</i>

00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,386
<i>go into the stomach.</i>
<i>I know for me it did.</i>

00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,254
If you don't make
an impression,

00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:46,323
you know, those two roses
or any rose

00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,026
<i>might not be yours and you</i>
<i>might be going home, so,</i>

00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,328
<i>you know, I think it made it</i>
<i>all real for everybody.</i>

00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,964
- The clock is ticking.
- So many guys.

00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,732
- You have to be a little
cocky in this situation.

00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,034
You have to kind
of get yourself out there.

00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,535
- Gotta get in there.
- Yeah.

00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,570
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,106
- Should we have our
whole conversation like this?

00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,075
- It would make it
a lot easier for me.

00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:07,711
I'd be a lot less nervous
if we did.

00:59:07,778 --> 00:59:08,812
I'm going for it.
I'm going for Gabby.

00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,080
You know what I'm saying?

00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:12,416
- I'm gonna try
to talk to Rachel right now.

00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,051
- Putting your flag in early.

00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:16,486
- I think the First Impression
Rose is everything.

00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,088
<i>I think that</i>
<i>would really set the tone</i>

00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,057
for the rest of our journey.

00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,259
I'm nervous.
My heart--you gotta feel.

00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,994
It is pounding out of my chest.

00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,028
- You should have
more to drink.

00:59:25,095 --> 00:59:26,396
[laughter]
- Yeah, I should.

00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:27,664
- Obviously, at some point,

00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,865
they're gonna end up
liking the same person.

00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:29,966
- It's gonna happen.
With 30 guys?

00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,635
- And then
how is that gonna work?

00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,203
It could be awkward.
They could get in a fight.

00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,371
You never know.

00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,006
Like, it's interesting
to think about.

00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,674
- Pressure is mounting
a little bit just to get

00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:39,109
that conversation,
I'm not gonna lie.

00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,278
- I would love
the First Impression Rose.

00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,580
<i>I am gonna try and get time</i>
<i>with Gabby and Rachel.</i>

00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:46,683
I think I would rather talk
to the real chicks

00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,454
rather than continue
to talk to these two.

00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,422
The bird just pooped
in my hand.

00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:55,025
So I wanted to get
something out of the way.

00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,159
- Okay.

00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:57,994
I'm dying to know
your biggest fear.

00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,763
- My biggest fear?
- Your biggest fear.

00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,931
Okay, on three, ready?

01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,165
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna say mine too.

01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,234
- Okay.
both: One, two, three.

01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,368
- Clowns.
- Sharks.

01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,736
Clowns?
- Sharks?

01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,105
- Okay,
I've heard there was, like,

01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,241
a couple clowns, like,
during the entrances today.

01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:13,410
So were you just terrified
out of your mind?

01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:16,012
- Wait, you're smooth.
That was a good one.

01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,582
<i>I am very attracted to Logan.</i>

01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,584
<i>He made me laugh.</i>

01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:23,286
I think
we're both very spontaneous.

01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,255
This is my first time
really out in California.

01:00:25,322 --> 01:00:26,990
- Yeah.
But I've always kind of wanted

01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:29,459
to see the Pacific Northwest,
as well, Washington...

01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,094
- Seattle.
- Yeah.

01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:32,429
- You busy in the next
couple weeks?

01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:33,730
- I don't know.
- You think we can make time?

01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,165
- Maybe.

01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,200
- I think maybe we could, like,
figure something out.

01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,836
<i>I was really happy</i>
<i>the way it went with Rachel.</i>

01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:41,605
It felt like we had
a real connection.

01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:44,207
<i>But navigating</i>
<i>two Bachelorettes,</i>

01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:46,443
<i>this is a really</i>
<i>difficult process.</i>

01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,745
- I'll see you inside.
- Absolutely.

01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:51,014
<i>I need more to go off of</i>
<i>before I can make</i>

01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,883
a decision
on who I want to pursue.

01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,352
- Did you speak with both?
- No, gosh.

01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,087
If I spoke with both,
that'd be pretty impressive.

01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:58,855
I don't think anybody has.

01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:01,658
- How are you tonight?
- I'm good. How are you?

01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:02,726
- I'm doing so well.

01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:03,960
- Where are your chicks?

01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,662
- The chicks.
- Did you ditch them for me?

01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,097
- They had
a little too much to drink.

01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,166
I had to call them a cab home.

01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:12,102
I still have a lot
to, like, learn about you.

01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,770
- Yeah.
- But you seem so fun.

01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,105
- Oh, thank you.

01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,340
- Like, when Shanae got
kicked out of the house

01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,509
and you just
double bottled up...

01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:21,778
- [laughing] Yeah!
- I'm like...

01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,747
- That's my hidden talent.
- Yeah.

01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:27,484
Okay, so are you the type
of person who goes into a movie

01:01:27,551 --> 01:01:29,786
and buys candy
at the concessions stand?

01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:30,987
- Oh.

01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,289
- Or do you bring,
like, a trench coat...

01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,524
- Right.
- And, like, stuff everything

01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,693
in the pockets
and kind of sneak in?

01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,762
- Yeah, the trench coat.
- The trench coat?

01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:40,997
- Like, a whole sandwich.
- God, I'm so relieved.

01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,732
- Yeah.
<i>Logan's great.</i>

01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,434
<i>He's super endearing.</i>

01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:46,570
<i>I feel like we have</i>
<i>similar senses of humor.</i>

01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,271
- I'll put corn dogs in there.

01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:49,906
- Yeah.
- Like, burritos.

01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:52,542
- Full--totally.
Like, hot dinner food.

01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:55,445
I am excited
to see where things go.

01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,948
We did have so much fun
and he's somebody

01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,883
that I have my eye on
for the future.

01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,484
- What are you
looking forward to most?

01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,987
- I'm looking forward
for it to be over--

01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,956
no, just kidding.
[both laugh]

01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:08,358
[chicks chirping]
- What do you think, guys?

01:02:08,425 --> 01:02:11,761
Gabby, Rachel, any preference?

01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,196
Yeah, I don't know.

01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:14,698
- You look beautiful tonight,
by the way.

01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,834
- Oh, thank you.
So do you. Beautiful.

01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,169
- Even with this tie?

01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:20,570
- Not that, but...
- Okay.

01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:22,072
What do you think
about the mullet, by the way?

01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:24,074
- But it was--
oh, I love a mullet.

01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,208
- You do? I was concerned.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:25,275 --> 01:02:26,443
One of my best friends
has a mullet.

01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:27,677
She's a girl.

01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,547
- Okay, that's--
[both laugh]

01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:32,315
- No, it looks good.
- Thank you.

01:02:32,382 --> 01:02:34,651
- Yeah, and you have,
like, a good natural curl.

01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,419
- Wow, this is just so nice.
Thank you so much.

01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,154
- Yeah, I'm not this nice
all the time,

01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,190
so don't get used to it.
[both laugh]

01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,858
Honestly,
I'm quickly thinking of a way

01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:44,828
to insult you, but it's not
coming fast enough.

01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,564
[both laugh]

01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,266
- Okay, well, I will
give you a compliment.

01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,501
- Oh, yeah, I'm here for that.

01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,603
- You look absolutely stunning.

01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:54,904
- Thank you.

01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,607
I have fake hair, a fake tan.

01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:58,842
- Do you really?
- No, I'm just kidding.

01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,043
Yeah, just a little bit
but you can't tell

01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,411
'cause boys are dumb.
- I know.

01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:02,712
You could have
fooled me easily.

01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,281
- Yeah, it's just a little bit.

01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,616
Just a little volume
in the back, you know?

01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:08,385
- The mullet's not real,
to be honest with you.

01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,153
It's also fake.
[both laugh]

01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,622
- Those are also extensions.
- These are extensions.

01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:13,823
- You can feel it up here.

01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,225
They just, like, clip in.

01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,326
Ah! No, I'm just kidding.

01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,496
[laughs]
- Stop!

01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,232
I don't know you enough
to trust that.

01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,600
<i>- I really like Erich.</i>

01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:25,101
It's just so easy with us.

01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,603
I feel like we were
making each other laugh.

01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,672
I could really
be myself around him.

01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,308
I honestly hate
groomed chest hair.

01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,076
- You know what?
I shaved my chest hair once.

01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,277
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,445
- Will never do that again
in my life.

01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,113
- Yeah.
- It's the worst.

01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,181
Have you ever shaved
your chest hair?

01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,749
- All the time.
[laughs]

01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,750
Let me see? Yeah, you're good.

01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,352
[both laugh]

01:03:42,419 --> 01:03:43,520
- I wax.

01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,155
- It gets prickly.
It's disgusting.

01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,589
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,225
- No, and, like, men are
allowed to have hair.

01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,493
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
