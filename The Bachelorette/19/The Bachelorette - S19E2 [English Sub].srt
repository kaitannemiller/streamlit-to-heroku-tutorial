01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,925
- For my job, I own a seasonal
business on a boardwalk.

01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,827
- The Jersey Shore boardwalk.

01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,896
- Yeah, exactly.
- Is that where you work?

01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,431
- Yes. My brother--
- No way!

01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,833
- My brother and I own a bunch
of the basketball games

01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,604
up there, so we got 60 seconds.
- Mm.

01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,139
- Whenever you're ready--
oh, it started up.

01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,641
- Oh, I only have one.

01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,576
I only have one!

01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:28,211
- How many do you have?

01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,747
I was about to block you too.
No way.

01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,383
- No, the Bulls
aren't very good.

01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,186
- What did you just--
- I don't know what to say!

01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,288
- All right, well I won
at the end of the day,

01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,557
so I think I get a kiss.

01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:43,226
[romantic music]

01:02:43,293 --> 01:02:45,161
- After my one-on-one
with Jordan,

01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:48,732
it was extremely disheartening,
but then tonight,

01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,967
I'm like,
so pleasantly surprised,

01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:54,471
like, oh, my gosh, I feel,
like, really good again.

01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:58,008
I hope that Gabby's having
as much fun as I'm having.

01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:00,510
- Like, I am excited
to get to know you.

01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,678
- Yeah.
- Like, you do seem like

01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:03,680
a really, like, amazing person.

01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:06,116
I thought we had, like, a--
- Do you have a mullet?

01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,586
- Yes, it's--
it doesn't go anywhere.

01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:10,820
Do you want to know
something ridiculous?

01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,689
- What?
- I was gonna come in tonight,

01:03:12,756 --> 01:03:13,990
like, I was gonna, like,
have you--be able

01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:15,558
to cut my hair?
- No, I'm so good at it.

01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,860
You should have.

01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,162
You look terrible.

01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,831
[both laughing]

01:03:23,066 --> 01:03:24,634
- These guys tonight,

01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:26,603
they were kissing us,

01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,307
they were planning out fun
games and dates and activities.

01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:31,841
I was laughing all night.

01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:32,942
- Uh-huh.

01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,279
That's considered out,
but we made it.

01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,481
[laughing]
Good job.

01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,852
- I finally feel like
the Bachelorette tonight.

01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,921
- To tonight,
first Rose Ceremony,

01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:46,690
first actual Rose Ceremony.
- First real Rose Ceremony.

01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,425
- First real Rose Ceremony.

01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,094
- I think we
should talk about

01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,697
what happened
in the house with Chris.

01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,998
Um...
- Right.

01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:57,600
- Do you feel like,
you know, one of us should

01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,602
kind of bring it
to their attention?

01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,104
- I mean, if we could bring her
over here and sit her down,

01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:03,406
I 100% speak on basically

01:04:03,473 --> 01:04:04,474
what we talked about
that night.

01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,542
- I just--
I think it's important

01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,710
for them to know his character.

01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:08,345
They need to know
the type of guys

01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,413
who are in this house,
and they're making decisions

01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,748
based off that.
- Yeah.

01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,316
- What he said was,
if you made it

01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,085
to Fantasy Suites,
and if you were

01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,986
the third one to go--
- He would leave them.

01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:18,188
- Well, I feel like
because of what

01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,223
they went through,
I feel like I, you know--

01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,858
- Well, they're
even more sensitive.

01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:23,326
- On the situation. Yeah.
- Exactly. Right.

01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:25,395
- They just went to the same
situation that he addressed.

01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:26,830
- Yeah.

01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:29,065
- Oh, yeah, they're gonna
want to know, of course.

01:04:29,132 --> 01:04:31,501
If someone says
something about me

01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:34,471
and then you didn't tell me,
I will actually be

01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,907
more offended that
you didn't tell me.

01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,342
- Hello, how are you doing?

01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,144
It's nice to finally
get to talk to you.

01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,413
- I know.
- Oh, you're walking? Awesome.

01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,382
I love the suit.

01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,650
- I have to address, you know,
what's happening in the house.

01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,185
- What do you mean?

01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:53,356
- I think whoever overheard
the conversation and doesn't

01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:56,126
bring it to their attention
is basically

01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:59,129
keeping secrets
from their wife.

01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,797
- What's going on?

01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:05,535
- Honestly, we just wanted
to talk about Chris.

01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,904
I wouldn't want you
to not know something,

01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,706
so I want it
to be very truthful

01:05:09,773 --> 01:05:11,107
and allow you
to give you a situation.

01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:12,108
- Okay.

01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:13,676
- So Chris

01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,678
was talking to a few guys
this week

01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,516
about Fantasy Suites,
and his whole talk was,

01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,785
"If I made it
to Fantasy Suites,

01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,453
"and if they had
slept with anyone,

01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,888
I would walk out and leave."

01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,156
- Okay.

01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,991
- So I asked
a simple question:

01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,959
"Would you bring
this up before?"

01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,628
And he couldn't
answer the question.

01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,396
- So people are talking
about Fantasy Suites?

01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,031
- No, not everybody.

01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,766
- Who was talking about it?
- It came up.

01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,101
Chris brought it up
in a conversation.

01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:39,602
- So he's bringing it up.
- Yes. Yeah.

01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,471
- I don't even know why sex
is being brought up.

01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:42,739
- Yeah.

01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,607
- I can't believe
this is happening.

01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:46,609
When I came into this,
I didn't want to look like

01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:49,245
a girl that just got brought
to Fantasy Suites

01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:52,649
and, you know,
almost sexualized in a way.

01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,919
To hear that being brought up
before I have a conversation

01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,488
with someone is truly
almost my biggest fear.

01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,089
Okay, I just do want
to thank you guys.

01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,525
I'm gonna step away,
and I'm gonna talk to Gabby.

01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:08,298
The fact that Chris is already
discussing ultimatums

01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,934
to try to take control
of our journey,

01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,102
it just is
extremely upsetting,

01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:16,039
and it's not how I wanted
this night to go.

01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,541
Hi, sorry, Justin.
- Oh, hi.

01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,009
- Gabby, can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,311
- Yeah, oh, my gosh, yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,712
- Okay.
- Yeah, please.

01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,647
- Sorry about that.
- No, please, by all means.

01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,382
- Yeah, we'll go outside.
- Okay.

01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,818
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God what?

01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:30,186
- Yeah
- Tell me.

01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,496
- I just got brought
some information from Quincey,

01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,332
Jordan, and Hayden.
- Yeah.

01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,901
- They brought me over,
and they told me that

01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:48,838
Chris is, like, talking about
Fantasy Suites already.

01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:50,874
- Ew, what is he saying
about it?

01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:53,376
- He was basically saying
that if he was ever

01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,579
in a position where he
was brought to Fantasy Suites

01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,981
and we slept with someone else,

01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:01,384
that he would leave,
but he wouldn't tell us.

01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,521
- What?
- Yeah.

01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,955
- I'm pretty shocked.

01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,957
I haven't even had
one conversation with Chris,

01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,159
so for him to already be
talking about Fantasy Suites

01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:13,596
is--actually, it's, like,
entirely ridiculous.

01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:18,167
- I think we do owe him
the opportunity to speak to us

01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,702
if you're okay
with hearing him out.

01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:20,970
- Yeah.

01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:23,172
It seems very controlling,

01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:26,709
and I think it's disrespectful
of our journey and our process.

01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,611
- I feel bad that we had
to address it because I saw

01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,113
a look on her face
and she was just, like--

01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,015
- She was like, what the hell?
- She was [bleep] disgusted.

01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,384
- 100%, she felt
extremely disrespected.

01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,319
- Oh, yo, bro, leave them.
Bro, leave them.

01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:37,921
[tense music]

01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,656
- Oh, good. Thank God.

01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,157
- Hi.

01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:42,625
Chris, can we speak with you?

01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:43,693
- Yeah, I'd like to.

01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,194
- If you'd like
to come with us.

01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,362
- Yeah.

01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,031
- This is about
to [bleep] everything up.

01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,165
- Yeah.
- No joke.

01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,734
- Nice to finally
meet you.

01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,503
- So do you feel like
it's appropriate to be talking

01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,204
about Fantasy Suites
this early?

01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:58,207
♪ ♪

01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:01,544
- Yeah, so I sat down
with the guys the other day,

01:08:01,611 --> 01:08:04,981
and Fantasy Suites
was a conversation at the time.

01:08:05,048 --> 01:08:06,983
You guys maybe had
some questions about it?

01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,051
- I don't think
we have questions.

01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,419
We'd like to hear from you.

01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:12,522
- Yeah, I think
it's an appropriate thought

01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:13,723
because the reality is,

01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,525
if I were gonna be able
to find love,

01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,827
I tend to think all the way
through till the end

01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,729
and then be able to work it
backwards from there.

01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:21,230
So that would be my response.

01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,766
- Okay, but I guess
the problem I have is,

01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,236
they were saying that
if you were in a situation

01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,705
where you were
in a Fantasy Suite,

01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,541
that if Gabby or I decided
to be intimate

01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,677
with someone else,
that you would just leave

01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,312
and you wouldn't ever tell us

01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:38,448
that that was
an ultimatum for you.

01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,216
And I think--
- That's not--I always want in

01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:43,052
relationships, the opportunity
for me to be able to speak

01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,622
for myself first
rather than for somebody else

01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:46,990
to tell you what my words are.

01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,859
Like, my exact
verbatim wording was,

01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:52,362
"I wouldn't want to be
in a situation

01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,731
"where that person
who I was interested in

01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:57,000
"had a sexual relationship
with somebody else,

01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:57,967
"and then myself.

01:08:58,034 --> 01:08:59,035
"At that situation,

01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:00,770
"I wouldn't be
interested anymore

01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,138
in continuing
the relationships."

01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:05,041
I'm not taking away
anybody else's decision.

01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:07,043
And that's something
that I would never want to do

01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,745
to a female is take away
their decision.

01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,980
- I understand that you're
thinking way far in advance,

01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:13,383
