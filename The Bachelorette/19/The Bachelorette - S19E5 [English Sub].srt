This morning,
Logan did come to my room.

00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,195
He told me that he
is interested in pursuing

00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,631
a relationship with Gabby.

00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:57,102
And this is something
that Gabby and I--

00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,837
it was kind of
our biggest fear.

00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,974
But I thought we were farther
enough in this process

00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,643
where this wasn't gonna happen.

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,914
It's just tough, like,
the constant rejection.

00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,284
And I do want to, like,
open the floor--

00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,986
like, if you guys, like,
don't want to be here,

00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,889
like, you do not have to be.

00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,625
If anyone, you know,
has any concerns

00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:21,794
or wants to leave just--

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,262

I definitely feel
very vulnerable and nervous.

00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,675
When you are rejected,
it makes you question yourself.

00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,477
It makes insecurity come up.

00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:39,845

00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,347
- Yeah, of course.

00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,116
I would be lying
if I said I didn't think

00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,584
other people would walk out.

I'm just having a really
hard time moving forward.

I don't know if I can,

00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,652
I originally had
a connection with Gabby,

00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,855
but I decided
I was gonna pursue Rachel

00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,324
because she saw
something in me,

00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,594
and she told me that we
could have something special.

00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,733
As time went on, I didn't
quite see the same thing.

00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,771
So I met with Rachel,
and I told her

00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,606
"I can no longer see you,"

00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,709

with Gabby.

00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,979
And I got word today
that she wants me

00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,248

it's just--
I don't--I don't get it.

00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:29,594

her person in the guys here,
and for someone else

these established
relationships,

00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,769

Logan's been

00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:19,037
back and forth a little bit.

00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:20,772

crazy about Rachel.

the group date rose.

that's gonna happen.

- The addition of Logan,
it is a wake-up call,

00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,082
and it has some of
the guys, including myself,

00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,784
on alert to kind
of reevaluate, like,

all of me,

so natural.

got to be together.

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,564
- The only bloop was obviously
the new Logan addition,

00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,399
but even then like--
- Yeah, how did you--

00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,800
like, how did you take it?

00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:26,304

and I was like, "Okay,

00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,638
this is what's going on."

00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,475
But honestly, you should
explore every relationship.

00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,710
Like, I want to be chosen.
- Yeah.

00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:35,246
- So just know that you have
my support in all of this.

00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:36,247
- Yeah.
- You do.

for you guys,

I think emotions are high,

I hope that they just trust me.

progresses afterwards,

00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,205
Growing up, my parents
were like never together.

00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,174
You know, I lived with
my mom for a few years

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,276
and then I moved to with
my dad for, like, the rest

00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,677

00:53:33,744 --> 00:53:36,013

00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,650
- I was ten, which was tough.

00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:40,951
I didn't want to do it.

00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:42,252
I was like,
"I don't want to be here.

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,922
Can you send me back?"
type of thing.

00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,558
And I didn't get to see Mom
that often.

00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,460
You know, our relationship
to some extent

00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,562
was like through a phone for
a while, you know what I mean?

00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:54,965
Which was tough like,
in high school, and it sucked.

00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,267
And honestly like, you know,

00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,203
you want to have like
a stable relationship

00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,338
with both your parents,
but I just really

00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,307
never saw her that much.

00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,243
So you know, me and my mom
got really close

00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:07,878
when I got older,
because of all the time

00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,413
that we didn't have
when I was younger.

00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,852
So in regards to all that, she
kind of made something for me,

00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,987
and it's kind of
like a good luck,

00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,589

00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:22,092
So it's like this little
like, rubber bracelet thing.

00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,827

- Yeah.

00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,229

00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,297

how, you know,

00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:30,067
these last couple of weeks
have been tough for you,

00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:32,503
I think like, if you hold
on to it for a while,

00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,205
maybe it'll like turn
your experience in all this

00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,940
around for a little bit,
you know, so...

00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:41,211
- Well, you are turning this
around just starting with that.

00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,312
- Yeah.

00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,549

incredible.

this rose?

00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:18,015
- Absolutely, of course I will.

00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:22,219

01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:04,893

I wasn't sure that Logan
was gonna show,

01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:10,466
but now I know that,
you know, he's here.

01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,235
And he is vying for Gabby's
affection and love,

01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:16,739
so welcome to the squad,
I guess.

01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,674
So Michael and Mario
are going, huh?

01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:20,342
- Yeah.
- Wow.

01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:21,977
- I would respect it
if it was Mario,

01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,846
because he's
been putting in work.

01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:26,348
But to each his own.

01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,017
In all honesty,
it was tough to see,

01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,186
but weak links are gone.

01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,021
- Thank you.

01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,257
Hi.
- Hey, Gabby.

01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,192
- And [bleep] is getting real.

01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:39,027
- Hello.
- How're you doing?

01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,028
- Good.

01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:41,363
- Everyone's a hitter.

01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:44,933
- We are setting sail
to a place

01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:47,169
where it's very romantic.

01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:48,237
Shocker.

01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:50,139
- It's an even playing field
now,

01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,775
and it's anyone's game,
so might as well be my game.

01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:57,246
- Somewhere that's known
for its landscapes.

01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,715
- There's no point
in stopping now.

01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,250
Full speed ahead.

- Still to come this season
on "The Bachelorette"...

01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:11,059
- I can say now
with confidence,

01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,895
I am falling in love with you.

01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:16,198

I'm on cloud nine right now.

Everything I ask for,
you really embody it.

01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:22,671
I really can't imagine
my life without you.

01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:25,774
This is the best day ever.

01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:28,510
- I've always wanted
to be with someone like you,

01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,746
but just never knew
if it was possible.

01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:34,550
He has, like, really shown me
what it's like to feel loved.

She was in tears.

- I feel awful.
- You gotta pack your bags.

not just being a mom,
