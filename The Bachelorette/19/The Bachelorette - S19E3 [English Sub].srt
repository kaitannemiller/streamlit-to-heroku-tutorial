00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,989

to tell you that...

- Okay,

I--I looked at that today

I don't want to say
rough around the edges,

00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:01,932
but y'all want people
to be very direct with y'all,

00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:03,801

I wanted to make sure

00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,669

00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,371

freaking out all week

to be the Bachelorette.

"rough around the edges,"

00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:28,926

to talk to you because,

joke around and just be, like,

cause a ton of laughter,
